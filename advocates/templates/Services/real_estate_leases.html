                We provide end-to-end legal support in property transactions to ensure our clients acquire clean and legally secure titles. We conduct due diligence on the property. This includes verifying the authenticity of the title deeds, confirming the property's ownership status, ascertaining the presence/absence of encumbrances, caveats, cautions or disputes, and ensuring full compliance with land and planning regulations.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Beyond verification, we draft, review and negotiate lease and sale purchase agreement for both purchasers and vendors/sellers. We also witness these agreements.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Once the transaction is concluded, we oversee the transfer and registration process to ensure that ownership is vested in our clients.
            </p>

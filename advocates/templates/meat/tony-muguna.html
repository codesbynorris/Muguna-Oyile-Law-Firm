          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            Tony Muguna is a dynamic and results-driven Advocate, currently practising as the Commercial and Litigation Lead at Muguna & Oyile Advocates — 
            a forward-thinking law firm based in Nairobi and Meru, Kenya. With a deep command of corporate, commercial, and dispute resolution practice, 
            Tony has earned a solid reputation for his tactical precision, strategic insight, and client-focused approach in both contentious and 
            non-contentious matters.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-3">
            Tony routinely advises corporations, financial institutions, start-ups, NGOs, and high-net-worth individuals on corporate structuring, 
            M&A, joint ventures, shareholder agreements, cross-border transactions, and regulatory compliance. He also has a strong foothold in real estate, 
            employment, and banking and securities law. In litigation, Tony is known for handling complex commercial disputes, debt recovery, contractual 
            enforcement, IP infringement, and land-related cases — always focused on achieving commercially sound outcomes.

          <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            Outside of work, Tony is a passionate supporter of rugby — both locally and internationally. He avidly follows Kenya’s Shujaa (7s) and Simbas (15s) teams, 
            and is a lifelong fan of the South African Springboks. A lover of nature and adventure, he often escapes the city to explore Kenya’s landscapes, 
            finding inspiration and clarity in the wild.
